## Description

Simple exercise for the [MrBayes program](https://github.com/NBISweden/MrBayes).

To build a PDF with instructions from the file `mb-lab.lyx`,
you need to have [LyX](https://www.lyx.org) installed.

Then:

    $ git clone https://github.com/nylander/MrBayes-exercise.git
    $ cd MrBayes-exercise
    $ make

This will create the file `mb-lab.pdf` in the current working directory,
and also create a folder `www/mb` with some files for easy distribution.
